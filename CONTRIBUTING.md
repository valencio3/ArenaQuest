## 🌿 Branch Strategy

| Branch | Environment | Auto Deploy? |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Production | ✅ Yes — after PR approval and merge |
| `develop` | Staging / Preview | ✅ Yes — automatically on push |
| `feature/*` | PR Preview | ✅ Yes — Cloudflare Pages Preview per PR |

### Rules

- **`main`** is the stable, production-ready branch. Direct pushes are **not allowed**. Changes land here only via a reviewed and approved Pull Request from `develop`.
- **`develop`** is the integration branch. All completed features are merged here first and deployed to the staging environment automatically.
- **`feature/*`** branches are short-lived and created from `develop`. They are merged back into `develop` via Pull Request.
- **`hotfix/*`** branches may be cut from `main` for critical production fixes and merged back into both `main` and `develop`.

## 🔄 Workflow Overview

```
main ◄──────────────────── PR (after staging validation)
  │
develop ◄──────────────── PR (feature complete)
  │
feature/my-feature ◄───── your work here
```

### Step-by-step

1. **Sync your local `develop`**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/short-description
   ```

3. **Develop, commit, and push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(scope): short description"
   git push origin feature/short-description
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request** targeting `develop`.
   - A Cloudflare Pages Preview URL will be generated automatically.
   - Ensure all CI checks pass before requesting review.

5. **After approval**, the branch is merged into `develop` via squash or merge commit.

6. When `develop` is stable and validated in staging, a **release PR** is opened from `develop` → `main` and deployed to production after approval.

## ✍️ Commit Convention

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

### Types

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation changes only |
| `style` | Formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (no logic change) |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Build process, tooling, or dependency updates |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration changes |

### Scopes (examples)

| Scope | Area |
|---|---|
| `web` | `apps/web` (Next.js front-end) |
| `api` | `apps/api` (Cloudflare Workers) |
| `shared` | `packages/shared` |
| `infra` | Infrastructure and CI/CD |
| `docs` | Documentation |

### Examples

```bash
feat(api): add authentication middleware
fix(web): correct scroll behavior on kyu page
docs: update branch strategy in CONTRIBUTING.md
chore(infra): upgrade wrangler to v4
```

## 🔀 Pull Request Guidelines

- **Target branch:** Always target `develop` (never `main` directly, except for hotfixes).
- **Title:** Follow the commit convention format — `type(scope): description`.
- **Description:** Explain *what* changed and *why*. Link related issues with `Closes #<issue-number>`.
- **Size:** Keep PRs focused. Large PRs should be split into smaller, independent changes.
- **Checks:** All CI checks (lint, build, tests) must pass before review.
- **Reviews:** At least **one approval** is required before merging.

## 🛠️ Local Development Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js ≥ 20
- pnpm ≥ 9

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ArenaQuest.git
cd ArenaQuest

# 2. Install all dependencies
make install

# 3. Start all apps in development mode
make dev

# — or start apps individually —
make dev-web   # Next.js at http://localhost:3000
make dev-api   # Cloudflare Worker at http://localhost:8787
```

Run `make help` to see the full list of available commands.

## 🎨 Code Style

- **TypeScript** is enforced across the entire monorepo.
- **ESLint** is the linter — run `make lint` before opening a PR.
- **Prettier** is used for formatting in `apps/api` (see `.prettierrc`).
- Avoid commented-out code. Remove dead code before merging.
- Write meaningful variable and function names — code is read more than it is written.

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

- 🐛 **Bug report** — describe the expected vs. actual behaviour, reproduction steps, and environment.
